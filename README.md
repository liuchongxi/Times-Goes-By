This is a Python program that will calculate how much time passed between two dates in different formats.

    The program will ask for 6 number inputs representing the 2 dates. 
    It will ask one number after another in the following order: year, month, date.
    The program will then display three results:
        1. The number of days that passed since 1901/01/01 for both dates
        2. How many days have passed between the datates
        3. Result 2 expressed as number of years, months, and days.

Please run the program via Python 2.7 IDE.
